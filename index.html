  <h3>HOW WE SHAPE TECHNOLOGY — AND HOW TECHNOLOGY SHAPES US</h3>

  <p><i>What we make, makes us.</i><!--We make the world we inhabit.-->  These words begin <i>Artful Design</i>, a manifesto of how we shape technology, and a meditation on how technology shapes us in turn.  Investigating design through the vehicle of music and technology, the book begins with a simple question: What <i>is</i> design?  In pursuit of that answer, <i>Artful Design</i> takes the reader on a journey of discovery — of the nature, meaning, and purpose of design in this age of technology, and the many related questions that arise.  Why should we design <i>beauty</i> into <i>useful</i> things?  What does it mean to design <i>well</i>?  To what extent can (and should) the things we engineer embody our <i>values</i> as human beings?  Why does design... <i>matter</i>?  This book is for anyone who has ever been curious (excited or concerned) about technology — both what it does for us, and what it does <i>to</i> us.</p>

  <h3>A DESIGN MANIFESTO — IN COMIC FORM</h3>
  <p><i>Artful Design</i> is meticulously designed in the medium of a full-color <i>photo comic</i> book.  It is  uncompromising (it requires some thinking) yet accessible (due to its unconventional visual format).  A book about "the soul" of design, it is itself an artifact of design.</p>
  <p>The world of <i>Artful Design</i> is revealed both conceptually and concretely through the design of tools, toys, games, mobile apps like <i>Ocarina</i>, musical instruments, and social experiences.  It contains over 100 principles of artful design, and "design etudes" (i.e., expressive exercises) for the reader to explore and enact in everyday life.  Across its eight chapters, the book articulates an overarching practical philosophy of design that seeks to understand us as human beings.</p>

  <h3>FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR GE WANG</h3>
  <p>A Stanford Music professor with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, a designer/engineer/artist hybrid working at the intersections of disciplines, and an accidental entrepreneur (he co-founded Smule), Ge doesn't neatly fit any profile.  He designs programming languages for music, instruments and apps (like the award-winning <i>Ocarina</i>) for mobile devices and virtual reality.  He directs the Stanford Laptop Orchestra.  He loves food.  He plays Starcraft (but is still a noob after 20 years).  He shoots <i>a lot</i> of photographs.  He is a Guggenheim Fellow and has spent three years writing this book. (During this time, he has become good friends with the excellent people of Stanford University Press.) | 
  <a href="author.html">Learn more about the author</a>.<br><br>
  Based on <i>Artful Design</i>, Ge teaches a Stanford Continuing Studies course <a target="_blank" href="dsn100/"><b>DSN</b>100 | Artful Design: How We Shape Technology and How Technology Shapes Us</a> (online and open to all), <a target="_blank" href="think66/"><b>THINK</b>66 | Design that Understands Us</a> (a critical thinking course at Stanford), and <a target="_blank" href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/256a/"><b>MUSIC</b>256a / <b>CS</b>476a | Music, Computing, Design</a> (a creative design course at Stanford).  He also hosts <a target="_blank" href="tv/">Artful Design <b>TV</b></a>, a weekly online series exploring coding, music, critical making with helpings of history and philosophy.</p>

  <h3>WHAT WE MAKE, MAKES US.</h3>
  <p>The things we design with technology, designs us.  We cannot unmake technology.  But we <i>can</i> shape it more artfully.  No matter your walk of life or what you think about technology or design, this book invites you to venture into a realm where the <i>technological</i> meets the <i>intangible</i>.
