What is the nature of design, and the meaning it holds in human life?  
What does it mean to design well -- to design ethically?  How can the 
shaping of technology reflect our values as human beings?

Meticulously designed as a comic book for the "engineer with a soul", 
Artful Design explores how we shape technology, and how technology 
shapes all of us in turn.  Using music technology as a vehicle, this 
book presents concrete case studies of tools, toys, music technology, 
instruments, software, games, and social networks.  Every chapter 
elaborates a set of design principles and strategies that illuminate the 
essential relationship between art and engineering, ethics and our 
technological-mediated society.

Written by Stanford University Professor and Smule Co-founder Ge Wang 
(designer of Ocarina and Magic Piano for the iPhone, creator of the 
ChucK music programming language, and director of the Stanford Laptop 
Orchestra), Artful Design is a genre- and discipline-crossing 
exploration into the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of technology -- 
and a meditation for all engineers, tool-builders, and anyone curious 
about design as a profound agent that shapes our world, our society, and 
ourselves.
