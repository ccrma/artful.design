Friends, engineers, philosophers lend me your ears!

For the past three years, and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, I have 
been working on a (488-page, full-color, comic) book -- ARTFUL DESIGN: 
TECHNOLOGY IN SEARCH OF THE SUBLIME -- a manifesto of how we shape 
technology, and a meditation on how technology shapes us in turn. Breaking 
down the design of tools, toys, wacky computer music instruments, video 
games, and social experiences, this book elaborates 100+ tacit principles 
of artful design and articulates an overarching aesthetic/moral-ethical 
dimension of technology. Published by Stanford University Press, ARTFUL 
DESIGN was created entirely in the medium of a photo comic book.

It's nerdy. It's philosophical. It's a core dump of my brain in 
comic form. And it's here.
